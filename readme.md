# Ajax_react 
## Intro

This project is where I work to make React and Ajax work together. I have been using React and Flask together in some of my projects but have been hitting walls when I want to make an ajax call. As of this writing, in June of 2017, this issue is causing me to not have full websites that could use react more thoroughly. Essentially, I want to use React as much as I can because I want to get proficient in it. Once I break through this 'wall' of not being able to use ajax and react together I believe that not only will my sites be nice but that I will have a greater understanding of React. I am also sure, that in this process, I will come to realize that there are other ways around my problem.
